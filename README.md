# Docu.Me - Documentation Portal Generator

Docu.Me generates clear,  searchable, easy-to-customize documentation portal for APIs from your Swagger specifications.
Built with Java and designed with Bootstrap and Jquery, it is based on the current version of the [Open API specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) formerly known as Swagger.
You can create your own swagger.yaml file with [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/).

This repo contains the content and specifications for the [Amadeus Travel Innovation Sandbox](https://sandbox.amadeus.com).  

This is a Spring boot project built with [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) (STS).
You can download/clone the repo and import it as an existing project into workspace in STS.
It is a Maven project so it has all required dependencies in the pom.xml.

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater](http://maven.apache.org/install.html)

This is a simple [tutorial](https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/) I followed to install them.

### Set API key as environment variable.
You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).
Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.

## Installation of Docu.me:
### From terminal

Go into the docuDemo folder :

	$ cd docu.me/docuDemo/
	$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="args1,args2"
	
 - args1 = Swagger yaml file location. For example "path/swagger.yml".
 - args2 = This parameter should be true if you want to generate examples on the fly by callling the API with default values or set to false.

Your command will look like:

	$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="path/swagger.yml,false"

### From Spring Tool Suite

* Import docuDemo folder as *Existing Maven Project*. Go to the DocuDemoApplication class and click Run configurations.
* Go to Arguments and pass  "args1,args2" as explained above.
* Go to Environment > New . Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.
* Click Apply > Run.

### From Eclipse

* Import docuDemo folder as *Existing Maven Project*. Go to the DocuDemoApplication class and click Run configurations.
* Go to Arguments and pass  "args1,args2" as explained above.
* Go to Environment > New . Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.
* Click Apply > Run.

## Output

* The output folder produced in your project folder contains index.html file with navigation to different APIs and response models of the API documentation.

### Customize it your way!

There are 3 pages to focus on:

### Index Page

Here we have list of APIs and list of response models in our APIs.

* The list of APIs come from the operationID present in the swagger.yml file.
* The list of models come from swagger.getDefinitions() which gives Map<String, Model>.


### API documentation page

We can see 10 sections on this page.

* Title : Title comes from the [info object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#info-object) mentioned in the swagger file.
* Summary : Summary tag from yaml file,[Operation object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operationObject).
* Description : Description tag from the yaml file,[Operation object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operationObject).
* HttpMethod : We get HttpMethod from path.getOperationMap(),[path](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#paths-object) which gives us Map<HttpMethod, Operation>.
* Resource URL : This is build using  schemes/host/basePath/paths from the [swagger yaml file](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#swagger-object).
* Query Parameters : Paramters object from the Operations contains [parameters](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject).
* Tags : Tags provided in the yaml file. This can be used for categorizing bunch of APIs together.
* Responses : Responses are provided by [Response](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#responsesObject) object.
* Example : Example section is displayed if you pass true for generating example data by calling the actual API,this is explained above while passing arguements to the application.
* Result : The response generated by 'Send request' is displayed here.
* Response Schema : This is created from the Model's definition provided by [Definition](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#definitionsObject) in the swagger yaml.

### Response model documentation page

All the response models are listed here with all of their elements.This information comes from [schemaObject](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject) mentioned in definitions object. Elements can be of type Array, String or Reference to another model.

## Mustache templates:

When you want to make changes to the look and feel of the documentation portal mustache templates can be customized.
* You can follow [Mustache.js](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) guide for tweaking the mustache files.
* A list of mustache variables are present in Documentation.java class.
* Here, index.mustache creates index.html, model.mustache creates model.html and api.mustache creates {{api}}.html.
* In addition to changing the mustache files, one can customize the html files , just in case you want to add some static content that your swagger file could not accommodate !

### Limitations for generating examples:

* Supports only API key authorization, can be worked on for OAuth authorization mechanism using swagger security tools.
* Your documentation portal will be generated as expected but you cannot 'Get a live response' which needs to call your API.
